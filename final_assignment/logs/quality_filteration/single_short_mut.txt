Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.3
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 8 cores

igzip detected. Using igzip for decompressing

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /mnt/d/datap/final_assignment/data/trimmed/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> data/samples/single_short_1_mut.fq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	145	CTGTCTCTTATA	100000	0.14
Illumina	1	AGATCGGAAGAGC	100000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	100000	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 145). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 1)


SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: data/samples/single_short_1_mut.fq
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 4.3
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 4.3). Setting -j 8
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to single_short_1_mut_trimmed.fq
